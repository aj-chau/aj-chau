## About Me
> Hey! I am a new graduate of Wellesley College, class of 2024.5-- with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in English. I focused on Computer Security topics all throughout college, with internships at Putnam Investments, Veracode, and MongoDB while doing research as part of Wellesley's Programming Systems Lab (PSL) and MIT's Cybersecurity @ Sloan. I have accepted MongoDB's offer back starting Feb 2025! \
>
> I am always open to conversation, and am looking for my next technical theater role as well. I have experience Production Managing, Stage Managing, Audio Design + Board Operator, as well as being a 'Master Electrician' of sorts. Would love to get involved in more Board Operating work.
